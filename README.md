# Horiseon

## Description 

I have taken a starter code for the Horiseon website,
I have removed 99.5% of the none semantic tags such as div,
I have fixed any broken links in this case it was the link for - **search-engine-optimization**,
I have taken un-needed sections out of the CSS.
I have rearranged the order of the CSS elements and classes to follow or more logical system of flow.
I have made sure all the alignment is correct.
